                    IEEE-IIITD is the student branch of the worldâ€™s largest
                    technical professional organisation dedicated to advancing
                    technology to benefit humanity. At IEEE-IIITD, the student
                    branch members get a chance to explore their interests by
                    organising the biggest events of the institute alongside the
                    most capable and creatively and technically driven students.
                    The membership gives the students networking opportunities
                    to meet and learn from fellow IEEE Student and Graduate
                    Student Members and engage with professional IEEE members.
                    We are driven to provide the student body with access to
                    technical research and knowledge. We strive to inculcate a
                    culture of research and generate excitement about the field
                    of technology by propagating the spirit of competitive
                    collaboration and organising engaging events. IEEE-IIITD
                    student branch also consists of the Women in Engineering
                    Sub-chapter and CompSoc sub-chapter.
                    <br /><br />
                    With one of the biggest and most diverse teams of all the clubs
                    and a roster of unique events and workshops, IEEE-IIITD is one
                    of the best places to be to hone your skills and have fun while
